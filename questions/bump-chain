RawVec::reserve
Vec::reserve
Vec::push

When the vector exhausts capacity, it requests the underlying raw vector
reserve an additional element. The RawVec first tries reallocating the
existing allocation to grow to support the extra element. This will always
fail with our bump-allocator implementation. When the realloc fails, it
requests a new allocation, which invokes our bump allocator's alloc method.

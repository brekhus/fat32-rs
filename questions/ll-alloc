If the data structures used by an allocator need to allocate memory that
means the allocator needs some kind of (presumably simpler) allocator. Using
an intrsuively linked list avoids this problem of needing to allocate memory
as the free allocations are the storage used to keep track of the free
allocations. with rusts allocator data model, the allocator doesn't need to
keep track of outstandng requests.

A combination of three records positively identify a LFN directory entry.

First, the attributes byte (0x0B) is always 0X0F. This combination of
attributes is nonsensical and ignored by most systems.

Second, the type byte (0x0C) is always 0.

Finally, if the start of file cluster (0x14, 0x1A) is marked 0 for LFNs in conjunction
with a non-zero value for the file size in bytes (0x1C).

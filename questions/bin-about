My bin allocator has 10 bins, ranging from 0 to 2^13 byte allocations. It
handles alignment by enforcing allocations are aligned to match the bin they
reside in. For example, a 4k allocation is 4k aligned. This simplifies
locating a suitable allocation but wastes storage.

Internal fragmentation is bounded to be 50% with my allocator design. This
could be improved by splitting allocations into smaller bins.

External fragmentation is unbounded in my allocator design. This is because
there is no mechanism to split large allocations or coalesce smaller
allocations.

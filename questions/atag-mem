The memory reported by the raspberry pi is 994050048 bytes starting at offset
zero. This is about 80 Megabytes shy of the reported 1 GiB. 21 Megabytes
appear to be allocated to the video device according to the command line. I
assume the remainder is the memory we reserved for the kernel image but the
memory regions apparenlty overlap, so I am uncertain.
